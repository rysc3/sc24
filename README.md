## Booth Calendar 
The link [here](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/1?cid=NjY1ODI0ZGI2NmI4YTRlNTcxMDU1NzBiMDk1NjExZGQ1YzkzOTEzNTVlZGNhMGM2MmRlOTdkYTY4YjI1YTJmNUBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t) will take you to the google calendar we'll use to track whenever someone will not be available at the booth. 

Whenever you plan something, just create a meeting on your personal calendar and invite me: ry.scherbarth@gmail.com . And I can copy it onto this shared calendar so we can all see it. There isn't really an easy way that I could find which would allow anyone to add an event, but this way we can all see when others are busy. 

Please add the info to the meeting you create about where you'll be as well. e.x. if I'm going to a workshop I create a meeting on my personal calendar called "Ryan Busy" at that time, add the location and in the description add what the talk is called etc. That way we know where to find you in the case there is an emergency we need you for.
